This state lasted until 1834 when it was invaded by Ndebele warriors and came under the rule of Lobengula. Lobengula soon found himself having to deal with Cecil Rhodes and the British South Africa Company (BSAC) and signed a contract giving up mineral rights to his land in exchange for guns, ammunition and money. A series of misunderstandings followed this agreement and the Ndebele found themselves fighting the BSAC.</p><p><strong>British Settlement and Administration</strong><br /> In 1888, Cecil Rhodes obtained a concession for mineral rights from local chiefs. Later that year, the area that became Southern and Northern Rhodesia was proclaimed a British sphere of influence. The British South Africa Company was chartered in 1889, and the settlement of Salisbury (now Harare) was established in 1890.</p><p><a href="https://kchikuse.github.io/shona/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rhodesia-flag.gif" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="1918579234" data-slb-internal="0" data-slb-group="30"><img class="wp-image-31 alignleft jetpack-lazy-image" alt="rhodesia-flag" src="https://kchikuse.github.io/shona/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rhodesia-flag.gif?resize=148%2C73&#038;ssl=1" width="148" height="73" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://kchikuse.github.io/shona/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rhodesia-flag.gif?resize=148%2C73&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" ><noscript><img class="wp-image-31 alignleft" alt="rhodesia-flag" src="https://kchikuse.github.io/shona/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rhodesia-flag.gif?resize=148%2C73&#038;ssl=1" width="148" height="73" data-recalc-dims="1" /></noscript></a>In 1895, the territory was formally named Rhodesia after Cecil Rhodes and it was under the British South Africa Company’s administration. In the early 1890′s the losing Ndebele allied themselves with the Shona and continued a guerilla war but eventually an agreement was reached to end the fighting.</p><p>By 1896, it was apparent to the Shona and Ndebele peoples that the Rhodesian government was not interested in their problems, thus the first Chimurenga was begun. Though this resulted in moderate success, it ended only a year later when the leaders were arrested and hanged. During the next 60 years, conflicts between blacks and whites continued. Laws were passed guaranteeing rights to whites and stripping them from blacks. Land was redistributed to whites and working conditions and wages declined. By the late 50′s two black political parties, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU) had sprung up but just as quickly they were banned and their leaders imprisoned.</p><p>In 1964 Ian Smith became prime minister of Rhodesia, replacing Winston Field, and started pressing for independence from Britain. The British imposed strict rules before they would grant independence and they included greater equality for blacks. Since Smith knew the whites would never agree to the conditions, in 1965 he made a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI). Sanctions imposed by Britain were ignored by most other western countries and the economy of Rhodesia actually improved. Conditions for blacks did not improve however and a resurgence of ZANU &amp; ZAPU guerilla warfare began to strike deeper and deeper. Whites began abandoning their farms. This became known as the second Chimurenga. Smith finally began to realize that something needed to be done. Negotiations between Smith and the black political parties began and broke down. Parties disagreed and fragmented. Years of negotiations continued as did white emigration.</p><p>In 1976, Ian Douglas Smith received tremendous international pressure, which he could not ignore, causing him to reach an agreement with the political leaders which would result in majority rule in two years. This resulted in the Internal Settlement of March 3, 1978 and general elections in April 1979 under a new Constitution, which provided 75 seats for blacks and 25 seats for whites in Parliament. All residents of Rhodesia over the age of 18, regardless of race or colour, were enfranchised for this election. Bishop Muzorewa’s UANC Party won a majority of the seats reserved for blacks and Ian Smith’s Rhodesian Front party won all 25 white reserved seats. The UANC took office in June 1979, and the country was renamed Zimbabwe Rhodesia. Although the British Conservative Party, while it was still the official opposition, had said they would recognize a majority government resulting from the Internal Settlement, they reneged on this promise when they came to power.</p><p><a href="https://kchikuse.github.io/shona/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Zimbabwe_flag.gif" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="1387305015" data-slb-internal="0" data-slb-group="30"><img class="alignleft jetpack-lazy-image" alt="Zimbabwe_flag" src="https://kchikuse.github.io/shona/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Zimbabwe_flag.gif?resize=151%2C101&#038;ssl=1" width="151" height="101" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://kchikuse.github.io/shona/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Zimbabwe_flag.gif?resize=151%2C101&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" ><noscript><img class="alignleft" alt="Zimbabwe_flag" src="https://kchikuse.github.io/shona/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Zimbabwe_flag.gif?resize=151%2C101&#038;ssl=1" width="151" height="101" data-recalc-dims="1" /></noscript></a>Instead, they demanded further negotiations, involving all internal and external political parties. The Lancaster House Conference took place in late 1979, at which the British Government, the UANC and the Patriotic Front (ZANU and ZAPU) agreed to participate in new elections, which commenced on 27 February 1980. Elections took place over three days, from 27 February to 1 March 1980, under the supervision of the British Governor. ZANU Patriotic Front won a majority of seats and Robert Mugabe became Prime Minister. In 1990 ZANU Patriotic Front amended the Lancaster House Constitution and Mugabe was appointed President and the country was renamed from Rhodesia to Zimbabwe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<br /> <strong>c.600-900</strong> Zhizo people populate and dominate the Limpopo region.<br /> <strong>c.900</strong> Leopard’s Kopje people replace the Zhizo, who move west into the Kalahari to form the Toutswemogala culture.<br /> <strong>1220</strong>-1290 Mapungubwe, the ﬁrst Leopard’s Kopje settlement to exhibit the characteristics of a state is established and thrives.<br /> <strong>1325-1450</strong> Great Zimbabwe succeeds Mapungubwe and establishes itself as the biggest political and economic centre south of the Zambezi.<br /> <strong>1450</strong> Great Zimbabwe succeeded by two contemporaneous states, Khami to the west and Mutapa to the north-east.<br /> <strong>1490</strong> Torwa ruler brieﬂy usurps Mutapa throne before he is deposed four years later by Chikuyo Chisamarengu.<br /> <strong>1506</strong> Portuguese establish presence in the Mutapa state.<br /> <strong>1515-30</strong> Sachiteve Nyamunda establishes an independent state in the south-east which blocks trade between the Portuguese on the coast and the Mutapa state.<br /> <strong>1550</strong> Venda language fully established in the Limpopo region, combining some Sotho and Shona elements.<br /> <strong>1569/77</strong> Portuguese attempt to invade the Mutapa state.<br /> <strong>1600</strong> Goba people move into the area around the conﬂuence of the Zambezi and Sanyati rivers.<br /> <strong>1606-09</strong> Mutapa Gatsi Rusere experiences the Matuzianhe revolt.<br /> <strong>1629</strong> Mutapa Mavhura Mhande signs the ‘capitulations’ and begins the reign of puppet Munhumutapas.<br /> <strong>1663-1704</strong> Mutapa Kamharapasu Mukombwe’s reign reverses losses to the Portuguese incurred during the reign of puppet Munhumutapas, expelling the Portuguese and redistributing land.<br /> <strong>1684</strong> Changamire Dombo defeats the Portuguese at the battle of Maungwe.<br /> <strong>1690</strong> Rozvi state and Changamire dynasty established in the west.<br /> <strong>c.1700</strong> Large-scale migrations out of Mbire and Buhera begin.<br /> <strong>1720s</strong> Hlengwe groups begin to form in the south-east, disrupting trade between the interior and Inhambane.<br /> <strong>1750</strong> Civil wars reach their peak in the Rozvi state.<br /> <strong>c.1750</strong> Sections of the Rozvi migrate out of the central state to form the Nambiya dynasty in the north-west and the Singo dynasty south of the Limpopo.<br /> <strong>1768</strong> The Hiya attempt an invasion of the Rozvi state.<br /> <strong>1824-32</strong> Several Nguni groups enter the Zimbabwean plateau and each ﬁghts the Rozvi state.<br /> <strong>1838</strong> Ndebele state established in the west, effectively replacing the Rozvi state.<br /> <strong>1857</strong> Ndebele successfully subject most major Shona chieftaincies to their rule.<br /> <strong>1870</strong> Lobengula signs the Tati Concession.<br /> <strong>1879</strong> Ndebele experience the ﬁrst serious military defeat by the Shona at Nyaningwe Chivi.<br /> <strong>1887</strong> Lobengula signs the Grobler Treaty.<br /> <strong>1888</strong> (<strong>Feb</strong>.)
